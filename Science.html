	<th><p> "India has made significant contributions to satellite technology through various projects, including GSAT and NAVIC. These satellites play a crucial role in weather prediction, navigation, and disaster management across India.
GSAT Series
The GSAT series of satellites, developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), provides a wide range of services, including:
Telecommunications: GSAT satellites provide transponder capacity for various telecommunications services, such as television broadcasting, mobile connectivity, and internet services.
Weather Forecasting: GSAT satellites carry meteorological payloads that provide data for weather forecasting, climate monitoring, and disaster management.
Navigation: GSAT satellites support navigation services, including the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).
NAVIC (IRNSS)
The Navigation with Indian Constellation (NAVIC) system, also known as the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS), is a constellation of seven satellites that provide navigation services to the Indian region.
Navigation Services: NAVIC provides accurate positioning, velocity, and time information to users in the Indian region.
Disaster Management: NAVIC helps in disaster management by providing location information and emergency alerts.
Aviation and Maritime: NAVIC supports navigation services for aviation and maritime industries.
Benefits of GSAT and NAVIC
The GSAT and NAVIC satellites have numerous benefits for India, including:
GSAT-7A: Launched in 2018, GSAT-7A provides military communications services.
NAVIC Expansion: ISRO plans to expand the NAVIC system to provide global navigation services.
New Satellite Launches: ISRO has a robust launch schedule, with several new satellites planned for launch in the coming years.
In conclusion, India's contributions to satellite technology through projects like GSAT and NAVIC have significantly improved the country's capabilities in weather prediction, navigation, and disaster management." </p></th>
