	<th><p> Brahmagupta (598-665 CE) was a renowned Indian mathematician and astronomer who made significant contributions to the fields of mathematics, astronomy, and physics. He is considered one of the most important mathematicians of ancient India.
Life and Works
Brahmagupta was born in 598 CE in Billamala, a town in the state of Rajasthan, India. His father's name was Jishnugupta. Brahmagupta was a Brahmin by caste and was educated in mathematics and astronomy.
Brahmagupta's most famous work is the "Brahmasphuta Siddhanta" (Corrected Astronomical System), a comprehensive treatise on mathematics and astronomy written in 628 CE. The book consists of 25 chapters and covers topics such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and astronomy.
Contributions to Mathematics
Brahmagupta made significant contributions to mathematics, including:
Zero and the Decimal System: Brahmagupta was one of the first mathematicians to use zero as a placeholder and to develop the decimal system.
Negative Numbers: Brahmagupta introduced the concept of negative numbers and developed rules for operating with them.
Quadratic Equations: Brahmagupta solved quadratic equations using a method that is equivalent to the modern quadratic formula.
Pythagorean Theorem: Brahmagupta provided a proof of the Pythagorean theorem and extended it to non-right-angled triangles.
Contributions to Astronomy
Brahmagupta made significant contributions to astronomy, including:
Planetary Motion: Brahmagupta developed a new model of planetary motion that was more accurate than the existing models.
Eclipses: Brahmagupta provided a detailed explanation of eclipses and developed a method for predicting them.
Astronomical Tables: Brahmagupta compiled astronomical tables that provided accurate positions of the planets and stars.
Legacy
Brahmagupta's works had a significant impact on the development of mathematics and astronomy in India and beyond. His book "Brahmasphuta Siddhanta" was translated into Arabic and Persian and influenced the development of mathematics and astronomy in the Islamic world.
Brahmagupta's contributions to mathematics and astronomy are still recognized today, and he is considered one of the greatest mathematicians of ancient India. </p></th>
